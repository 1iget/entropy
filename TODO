- Replace deleted getSiblingObject tests; this functionality is basically
  replaced by ordering of backend powerups.
- Write upgraders to transition from the old deprecated powerups and powerup
  location (previously they were installed on the store, now they should be
  installed on the StorageConfiguration to eventually allow for more than one
  configuration), and tests for the upgraders.
